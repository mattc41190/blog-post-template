As I finished my little demo projects I could post them to GitHub, archive them locally or delete them entirely without having useless chunks of code left hanging around on my computer in unknowable places.The only dependencies that I had on my machine were the languages themselves. All other dependencies (what few there were, were all kept together with the project itself). I have on several occassions attempted to learn Java in the same way.
